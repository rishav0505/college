<!--Create  another  .html  file  that  contains  a  heading  and  a  couple  of  paragraphs. 
You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into 
the same folder where your first .html is. 
After you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that 
the browser will load another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other 
page in the first page. 
You need to use the <a> and </a> tags in this exercise. Inside the tag <a> you 
need to use a href attribute that specifies which page will be loaded when the 
link is clicked.-->
